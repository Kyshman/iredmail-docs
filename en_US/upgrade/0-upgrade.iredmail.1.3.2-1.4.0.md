## General (All backends should apply these changes)

### Update `/etc/iredmail-release` with new iRedMail version number

iRedMail stores the release version in `/etc/iredmail-release` after
installation, it's recommended to update this file after you upgraded iRedMail,
so that you can know which version of iRedMail you're running. For example:

```
1.4.0
```

### Upgrade Roundcube webmail to the latest stable release (1.4.11)

!!! warning "Roundcube 1.4"

    Since Roundcube 1.3, at least __PHP 5.4__ is required. If your server is
    running PHP 5.3 and cannot upgrade to 5.4, please upgrade Roundcube
    the latest 1.2 branch instead.

Please follow Roundcube official tutorial to upgrade Roundcube webmail to the
latest stable release:

### Upgrade netdata to the latest stable release (1.30.1)

If you have netdata installed, you can upgrade it by following this tutorial:
[Upgrade netdata](./upgrade.netdata.html).

### Fail2ban: Fixed few issues in script `/usr/local/bin/fail2ban_banned_db`

Script `/usr/local/bin/fail2ban_banned_db` shipped in iRedMail-1.3.2 and
earlier releases have few issues:

- It can not store IP address when its country name contains quotes
- In some cases it can not correctly store matched log lines in SQL database.
  We now store (base64) encoded log lines instead, it also helps avoid possible
  SQL injection.

Please run command below as root user to get latest script with both issues fixed:

```
wget -O /usr/local/bin/fail2ban_banned_db \
    https://github.com/iredmail/iRedMail/raw/1.4.0/samples/fail2ban/bin/fail2ban_banned_db
```

Restarting `fail2ban` service is required.

### Postfix: Whitelist few big companies' HELO hostnames

Please prepend these lines in `/etc/postfix/helo_access.pcre` (Linux/OpenBSD)
or `/usr/local/etc/postfix/helo_access.pcre` (FreeBSD) to whitelist few big
companies' HELO hostnames, they may not have DNS records which causes Postfix
rejects them:

```
/^\d{1,3}-\d{1,3}-\d{1,3}-\d{1,3}\.mail-(mail|campmail)\.facebook\.com$/ OK
/^outbound-\d{1,3}-\d{1,3}-\d{1,3}-\d{1,3}\.pinterestmail\.com$/ OK
/\.outbound\.protection\.outlook\.com$/ OK
```

## For OpenLDAP backend

### Update iRedMail LDAP schema file

iRedMail-1.4.0 introduces 2 new LDAP attributes for subscribeable mailing list:

* `listModerator`: used to store moderators' email address of mailing list.
* `listOwner`: used to store owners' email address of mailing list.

With these new attributes, if self-service is enabled in iRedAdmin-Pro,
mailing list owner is able to login to iRedAdmin-Pro and manage profile and
members of owned mailing lists.

## For MySQL and MariaDB backends

#### Add new SQL table `vmail.maillist_owners` and drop 4 unused columns

  manage profile and members of owned mailing lists.
- 4 columns in sql table `vmail.mailbox` are not used anymore, it's safe to
  drop them now:
    - `allowedsenders`
    - `rejectedsenders`
    - `allowedrecipients`
    - `rejectedrecipients`

su - postgres
psql -d vmail < /tmp/iredmail.pgsql
