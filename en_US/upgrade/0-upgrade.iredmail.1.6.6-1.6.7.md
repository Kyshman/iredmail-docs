## ChangeLog

- Nov 9, 2023: initial publish.

## General (All backends should apply these changes)

### Update `/etc/iredmail-release` with new iRedMail version number

iRedMail stores the release version in `/etc/iredmail-release` after
installation, it's recommended to update this file after you upgraded iRedMail,
so that you can know which version of iRedMail you're running. For example:

```
1.6.7
```

### Upgrade netdata to the latest stable release (1.43.1)

If you have netdata installed, you can upgrade it by following this tutorial:
[Upgrade netdata](./upgrade.netdata.html).

### Upgrade Roundcube webmail to the latest stable release (1.6.5)

!!! warning "CentOS 7: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.2"

    __It's time to leave your comfort zone and upgrade this server to at least
    CentOS Stream 8 or [Rocky Linux 8](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/migrate2rocky/).__

    If you're running CentOS 7, please upgrade to Roundcube 1.5.2 instead.
    Roundcube 1.5.3 requires PHP-7, but CentOS 7 ships PHP-5.4 which is not
    supported by Roundcube 1.5.3 and later releases, including 1.6.x.

    __Unfortunately, Roundcube 1.5.2 does NOT contains multiple security fixes
    which shipped in Roundcube 1.5.6 and 1.6.5.__

!!! warning "Ubuntu 18.04: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.6"

    Ubuntu 18.04 runs old php version, v1.5.6 contains the security fix too.
    Anyway, please consider upgrading your OS to at least 20.04 LTS as soon as
    possible.

Roundcube v1.6.5 and 1.5.6 are security updates. [Both fix a cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability](https://roundcube.net/news/2023/11/05/security-updates-1.6.5-and-1.5.6).

Please follow Roundcube official tutorial to upgrade Roundcube webmail to the
latest stable release:
