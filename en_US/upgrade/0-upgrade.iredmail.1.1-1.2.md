## ChangeLog

* Apr 18, 2020: Add link of tutorial: [Track user last login time](./track.user.last.login.html).
* Apr 17, 2020: initial release.

## General (All backends should apply these changes)

### Update `/etc/iredmail-release` with new iRedMail version number

iRedMail stores the release version in `/etc/iredmail-release` after
installation, it's recommended to update this file after you upgraded iRedMail,
so that you can know which version of iRedMail you're running. For example:

```
1.2
```

### Upgrade iRedAPD (Postfix policy server) to the latest stable release

Please follow below tutorial to upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release:
[Upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release](./upgrade.iredapd.html)

### Upgrade Roundcube webmail to the latest stable release (1.4.3)

!!! warning "Roundcube 1.4"

    Since Roundcube 1.3, at least __PHP 5.4__ is required. If your server is
    running PHP 5.3 and cannot upgrade to 5.4, please upgrade Roundcube
    the latest 1.2 branch instead.

* [How to upgrade Roundcube](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Upgrade).

### Upgrade netdata to the latest stable release (1.21.1)

If you have netdata installed, you can upgrade it by following this tutorial:
[Upgrade netdata](./upgrade.netdata.html).

### Fixed: mail delivery abort if program 'altermime' is not available

The script `mlmmj-amime-receive` has a bug which may abort mail delivery if
program `altermime` is not available on the system, this update fixes it.

Run commands below to update file `/usr/bin/mlmmj-amime-receive` (Linux) or
`/usr/local/bin/mlmmj-amime-receive` (FreeBSD/OpenBSD):

On Linux:

```
cd /usr/bin/
wget -O mlmmj-amime-receive https://github.com/iredmail/iRedMail/raw/1.2/samples/mlmmj/mlmmj-amime-receive
chown mlmmj:mlmmj mlmmj-amime-receive
chmod 0550 mlmmj-amime-receive
```

On FreeBSD or OpenBSD:

```
cd /usr/local/bin/
wget -O mlmmj-amime-receive https://github.com/iredmail/iRedMail/raw/1.2/samples/mlmmj/mlmmj-amime-receive
chown mlmmj:mlmmj mlmmj-amime-receive
chmod 0550 mlmmj-amime-receive
```

## For OpenLDAP backend

### Improved last login track

!!! attention

    User last login track is optional if you didn't implement it while
    upgrading iRedMail to 1.0. Here's the full tutorial to implement last login
    track: [Track user last login time](./track.user.last.login.html).

In iRedMail-1.0, Dovecot is configured to store the time of user last login via
IMAP/POP3 in SQL database `iredadmin`, but it only tracks either POP3 or IMAP
login. In iRedMail-1.2, it tracks both. Please follow steps below to implement
this improvement.

* Open file `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf` (Linux/OpenBSD) or
  `/usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf` (FreeBSD), find the `last_login_key`
  parameter and replace it by below one:

```
    last_login_key = last-login/%s/%u/%d
```

* Open file `/etc/dovecot/dovecot-last-login.conf` (Linux/OpenBSD) or
  `/usr/local/etc/dovecot/dovecot-last-login.conf` (FreeBSD), __remove__ existing
  `map {}` block and __add__ 2 new `map {}` blocks used to track
  POP3/IMAP/LMTP/LDA services.

```
map {
    pattern = shared/last-login/imap/$user/$domain
    table = last_login
    value_field = imap
    value_type = uint

    fields {
        username = $user
        domain = $domain
    }
}

map {
    pattern = shared/last-login/pop3/$user/$domain
    table = last_login
    value_field = pop3
    value_type = uint

    fields {
        username = $user
        domain = $domain
    }
}
```

* Download prepared SQL file used to alter SQL tables:

```
wget -O /root/last_login.mysql https://github.com/iredmail/iRedMail/raw/1.2/update/1.2/last_login.mysql
mysql iredadmin < /root/last_login.mysql
rm -f /root/last_login.mysql
```

* Restarting Dovecot service is required.

### Fixed: can not store mail subject with emoji characters in `amavisd` database

In `amavisd` database, column `msgs.subject` is defined as `VARCHAR(255)`, it
doesn't support emoji characters. Please login to MySQL/MariaDB server as `root`
user or `amavisd` user, then run SQL commands below to fix it:

```
USE amavisd;
ALTER TABLE msgs MODIFY COLUMN subject VARBINARY(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
```

### [OPTIONAL] Fail2ban: Store banned IP addresses in SQL database

If you're running iRedAdmin-Pro, it's very useful to store banned IP addresses
in SQL database, then you can view and manage them with iRedAdmin-Pro directly.
