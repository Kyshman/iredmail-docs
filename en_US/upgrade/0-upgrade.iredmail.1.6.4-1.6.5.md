## ChangeLog

- Sep 20, 2023: initial publish.

## General (All backends should apply these changes)

### Update `/etc/iredmail-release` with new iRedMail version number

iRedMail stores the release version in `/etc/iredmail-release` after
installation, it's recommended to update this file after you upgraded iRedMail,
so that you can know which version of iRedMail you're running. For example:

```
1.6.5
```

### Upgrade iRedAdmin (open source edition) to the latest stable release (2.5)

Please follow below tutorial to upgrade iRedAdmin to the latest stable release:
[Upgrade iRedAdmin to the latest stable release](./migrate.or.upgrade.iredadmin.html).

### Upgrade netdata to the latest stable release (1.42.4)

If you have netdata installed, you can upgrade it by following this tutorial:
[Upgrade netdata](./upgrade.netdata.html).

### Upgrade Roundcube webmail to the latest stable release (1.6.3)

!!! warning "CentOS 7: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.2"

    If you're running CentOS 7, please upgrade to Roundcube 1.5.2 instead.
    Roundcube 1.5.3 requires PHP-7, but CentOS 7 ships PHP-5.4 which is not
    supported by Roundcube 1.5.3 (and the latest 1.6.0).

    __Unfortunately, Roundcube 1.5.2 does NOT contains the security fix which
    shipped in Roundcube 1.5.4 or 1.6.3.__

    It's time to leave your comfort zone and upgrade this server to at least
    CentOS Stream 8 or [Rocky Linux 8](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/migrate2rocky/).

!!! warning "Ubuntu 18.04: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.4"

    Ubuntu 18.04 runs old php version, v1.5.4 contains the security fix too.
    Please consider upgrading your OS to 20.04 LTS as soon as possible.

Roundcube v1.6.3 and 1.5.4 are security updates. Both fix a cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Please follow Roundcube official tutorial to upgrade Roundcube webmail to the
latest stable release:

* [How to upgrade Roundcube](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Upgrade).
