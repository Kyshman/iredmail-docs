## ChangeLog

* Jun 29, 2020: initial release.

## General (All backends should apply these changes)

### Update `/etc/iredmail-release` with new iRedMail version number

iRedMail stores the release version in `/etc/iredmail-release` after
installation, it's recommended to update this file after you upgraded iRedMail,
so that you can know which version of iRedMail you're running. For example:

```
1.3
```

### Upgrade iRedAPD (Postfix policy server) to the latest stable release

Please follow below tutorial to upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release:
[Upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release](./upgrade.iredapd.html)

### Upgrade mlmmjadmin to the latest stable release

Please follow below tutorial to upgrade mlmmjadmin to the latest stable release:
[Upgrade mlmmjadmin to the latest stable release](./upgrade.mlmmjadmin.html)

### Upgrade Roundcube webmail to the latest stable release (1.4.6)

!!! warning "Roundcube 1.4"

    Since Roundcube 1.3, at least __PHP 5.4__ is required. If your server is
    running PHP 5.3 and cannot upgrade to 5.4, please upgrade Roundcube
    the latest 1.2 branch instead.

Roundcube 1.4.6 fixes few security issues, all users are encouraged to upgrade
_as soon as possible_.

### Fixed: can not manage mail filters with Roundcube on CentOS 7

!!! attention

    This is only application to CentOS 7.

On CentOS 7, the Roundcube official plugin `managesieve` doesn't work with
TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2, so we have to re-enable TLSv1 in Dovecot, otherwise you
can not manage mail filters with Roundcube.

Open file `/etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf`, find the `ssl_protocols` parameter like
below:

```
ssl_protocols = !SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1 !TLSv1.1
```

Remove `!TLSv1` and restart Dovecot service:

```
ssl_protocols = !SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1.1
```

Note: TLSv1 and TLSv1.2 are supported with this change.

### Fixed: inconsistent Fail2ban jail names

!!! attention

    This is applicable to Linux and OpenBSD.

iRedMail-1.2 and 1.2.1 introduced [SQL integration in
Fail2ban](./fail2ban.sql.html), but there're few inconsistent jail names which
caused unbanning IP from iRedAdmin-Pro doesn't work. Please run commands below
to fix them.

```
cd /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/
perl -pi -e 's#dovecot-iredmail#dovecot#g' dovecot.local

perl -pi -e 's#postfix-pregreet-iredmail#postfix-pregreet#g' postfix-pregreet.local
perl -pi -e 's#name=postfix,#name=postfix-pregreet,#g' postfix-pregreet.local

perl -pi -e 's#postfix-iredmail#postfix#g' postfix.local
perl -pi -e 's#roundcube-iredmail#roundcube#g' roundcube.local
perl -pi -e 's#sogo-iredmail#sogo#g' sogo.local
```

## OpenLDAP backend special

### Add missing index for SQL column `msgs.time_iso` in `amavisd` database

Please run SQL commands below as MySQL root user:

```
USE amavisd;
CREATE INDEX msgs_idx_time_iso ON msgs (time_iso);
```

### Improvement: Store more info in Fail2ban SQL db

!!! attention

    Since iRedMail-1.2, Fail2ban is configured to [store banned IP addresses in 
    SQL database](./fail2ban.sql.html), if you're running an old iRedMail
    release, please upgrade your iRedMail server by following the upgrade
    tutorials: [iRedMail release notes and upgrade tutorials](./iredmail.releases.html).

With changes below, we now store more info in Fail2ban SQL database:

- Matched log lines which triggerred the ban
- Number of times the failure occurred until ban
- Reverse DNS name of banned IP address

Please run SQL commands below as MySQL root user:

```
USE fail2ban;
ALTER TABLE banned ADD COLUMN failures INT(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE banned ADD COLUMN loglines TEXT;
ALTER TABLE banned ADD COLUMN `rdns` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
CREATE INDEX rdns ON banned (`rdns`);
```

Now open file `/etc/fail2ban/action.d/banned_db.conf`, find the `actionban =`
line like below:

```
actionban   = /usr/local/bin/fail2ban_banned_db ban <ip> <port> <protocol> <name>
```

Replace it by:

```
actionban   = /usr/local/bin/fail2ban_banned_db ban <ip> <port> <protocol> <name> <ipjailfailures> <ipjailmatches>
```

Download improved shell script and replace the existing one:

```
cd /usr/local/bin
wget -O fail2ban_banned_db https://github.com/iredmail/iRedMail/raw/1.3/samples/fail2ban/bin/fail2ban_banned_db
chmod 0550 fail2ban_banned_db
```

Now restart Fail2ban service.

## MySQL/MariaDB backend special

### Add missing index for SQL column `msgs.time_iso` in `amavisd` database

Please run SQL commands below as MySQL root user:

```
USE amavisd;
CREATE INDEX msgs_idx_time_iso ON msgs (time_iso);
```
