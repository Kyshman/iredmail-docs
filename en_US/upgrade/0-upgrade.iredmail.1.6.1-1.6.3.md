## ChangeLog

- May 24, 2023: Mention breaking changes between Roundcube 1.5.x and 1.6.x.
- May 23, 2023: initial publish.

## General (All backends should apply these changes)

### Update `/etc/iredmail-release` with new iRedMail version number

iRedMail stores the release version in `/etc/iredmail-release` after
installation, it's recommended to update this file after you upgraded iRedMail,
so that you can know which version of iRedMail you're running. For example:

```
1.6.3
```

### Disable TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 in Postfix

!!! attention

    - TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are vulnerable to downgrade attacks since they rely on
      SHA-1 hash for the integrity of exchanged messages.
    - TLS 1.1 was deprecated in March 2021.

!!! warning "WARNING: CentOS 7"

    Do not apply this on __CentOS 7__, because TLSv1 is still required by
    Roundcube with old PHP 5.4. You should consider upgrade CentOS to at least
    CentOS Stream 8 or Rocky Linux 8, or AlmaLinux 8 as soon as possible.

Run shell commands below as root user to disable TLSv1 and TLSv1.1 for SMTP service:

```
postconf -e smtpd_tls_protocols='!SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1 !TLSv1.1'
postconf -e smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols='!SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1 !TLSv1.1'
postconf -e smtp_tls_protocols='!SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1 !TLSv1.1'
postconf -e smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols='!SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1 !TLSv1.1'
postconf -e lmtp_tls_protocols='!SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1 !TLSv1.1'
postconf -e lmtp_tls_mandatory_protocols='!SSLv2 !SSLv3 !TLSv1 !TLSv1.1'
postfix reload
```

### Upgrade iRedAPD (Postfix policy server) to the latest stable release (5.3)

Please follow below tutorial to upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release:
[Upgrade iRedAPD to the latest stable release](./upgrade.iredapd.html)

### Upgrade iRedAdmin (open source edition) to the latest stable release (2.3)

[Upgrade iRedAdmin to the latest stable release](./migrate.or.upgrade.iredadmin.html).

### Upgrade Roundcube webmail to the latest stable release (1.6.1). WARNING: There're breaking changes.

!!! warning "CentOS 7: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.2"

    If you're running CentOS 7, please upgrade to Roundcube 1.5.2 instead.
    Roundcube 1.5.3 requires PHP-7, but CentOS 7 ships PHP-5.4 which is not
    supported by Roundcube 1.5.3 (and the latest 1.6.0).

    It's time to leave your comfort zone and upgrade this server to CentOS
    Stream 8 or [Rocky Linux 8](https://docs.rockylinux.org/guides/migrate2rocky/).

!!! warning "Ubuntu 18.04: please stick to Roundcube 1.5.x"

    Ubuntu 18.04 runs old php version, v1.5.x contains the security fix too.
    Please consider upgrading your OS to 20.04 LTS as soon as possible.

!!! warning "PHP Version"

    Roundcube 1.6.x requires PHP 7.3 or later releases.

Please follow Roundcube official tutorial to upgrade Roundcube webmail to the
latest stable release:

!!! attention

    Please remove file `/opt/www/roundcubemail/composer.json` before upgrade.

* [How to upgrade Roundcube](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Upgrade).

Few changes  are required if you upgrade from Roundcube 1.5.x or earlier to 1.6.x:

- Main config file `/opt/www/roundcubemail/config/config.inc.php`:
    - Remove (or comment out) `smtp_server` and `smtp_port` parameters, add new
      parameter `smtp_host`.
    - Remove (or comment out) `default_host` and `default_port`, add `imap_host`.
    - Set `auto_create_user` to `true` (default value is `false`). Otherwise newly
      created mail users can not login to Roundcube.

```
$config["smtp_host"] = "tls://127.0.0.1:587";
$config["imap_host"] = "tls://127.0.0.1:143";
$config['auto_create_user'] = true;
```

- Plugin `managesieve` config file `/opt/www/roundcubemail/plugins/managesieve/config.inc.php`:
    - Remove (or comment out) `managesieve_port` and `managesieve_usetls`,
      add new parameter `managesieve_host`.

```
$config["managesieve_host"] = "tls://127.0.0.1:4190";
```

### Upgrade netdata to the latest stable release (1.39.1)
